# About
The ICARUS project is an initiative on utilization of automated full-electric microtransportation (segway) with zero emission energy 
generation and usage via solar panel powered station with battery energy storage system without inverting back to grid in AC (maximum efficiency). ICARUS
was going to be funded and implemented in ITB but the project is on hold right now due to funding problem.
